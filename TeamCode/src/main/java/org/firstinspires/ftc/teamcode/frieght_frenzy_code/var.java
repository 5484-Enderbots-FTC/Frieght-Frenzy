    //commonly used static variables can be stored here and used by multiple programs

    //the way you use them in other programs is by typing: var.variableName
    //ez pz :)

    //example:
    public static double toggleWait = 1; //(seconds)
    public static double intakeTiltDown = 0.9;
    public static double intakeTiltUp = 0;
    public static double fullPower = 1;
    public static double stop = 0;
